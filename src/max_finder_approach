max_finder_approach

pass the routine that the thread executes a struct
	struct contains the vector being operated on
	operate on the vector using pointers

pass a struct with a global variable array in it

each thread will perform a merge sort to manipulate its section of the global array variable

give each thread the original array and a left and right index to compare

check if left index is less than the right index
	compare the two numbers at that index
	if left is bigger, do nothing
	else
	// CRITICAL SECTION
		swap the two subarrays
		int leftCopy[r - l];
		for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i)
		{
			// generate copy of left subarray
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i)
		{
			// replace left subarray with right subarray
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i)
		{
			// replace right side with copy of left
		}
