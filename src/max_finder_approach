max_finder_approach

	parse command line input
	second argument is the text file
	open text file and insert integers into an array for analysis

	while largest integer is not found
		while all threads in current round are not finished (use)
			create n/2 threads, passing each one the two numbers
			each thread finds the larger of two numbers
			round two doesn't start until all n/2 threads are finished

	print the result, terminate program


thread synchronization
	implement a barrier




Specs
	integers to be analyzed are stored in a .txt file (all ints on one line)
	.txt file taken as command line argument
	num of ints is always a power of two
	num of ints will never be above 4096
